# Individual Reports

## Carl Gledhill (gledhil8)
- My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of the "Student Admin" user and related functions
    - https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/3a131d7c054d817033e1c506442e606dad2daf04 
    - https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/0e3e91edc2c41524aabdaaf5c466a7ad327d7403
- While working on our Calendar website the most significant technical concept I learned was how to use the Django framework and getting comfortable with the MVT design pattern
- My biggest strength as a team member was my ability to communicate with the group and verbalize our groups body of work by writing excellent Process/product reports.
- One thing I could improve on would be breaking up my commits into smaller pieces so fellow group members can be aware of my progress along the way.

## Michael Li (limich17)

- My most significant contribution was work on pushing notifications to users of the app, however my work did not end up being used in the final product, as there were too many issues with it.
- While working on the calendar I learned about the Django framework, and learned more about the software development process. 
- One of my strengths is that I made sure I kept track of what was going on in discussion in the group offline and online. 
- Something I need to improve on is meeting deadlines my group members set out for me.


## Tommy Li (tommyzli)
- My most significant contribution was the implementation of the user permissions. 
    - https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/blob/master/phase2/csc301_calendar_app/main/models.py
    - https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/blob/master/phase2/csc301_calendar_app/main/utils.py 
- While working on this project, I learned how Django handles user authentication and permissions in the back end. There were many options to choose from, including permission objects and user groups, as well as completely custom permission checks, which I chose.
- One of my strengths was that I stayed very up to date on the team’s progress, in meetings and in group chats to make sure I was not falling behind in anything.
- Something I could improve on is keeping my team members up to date on my progress by communicating more throughout the sprints and through more frequent commits.

## Sang-Ah Han (sangahhan)
- My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the calendar overlay feature, which was the main feature in relation to one of our milestones (user stories)
    - First functional commit for this feature: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/6d5c9df85e379db03e3379a488cd214cfcbe975c
- While working on our web application, I learned about how to use AJAX to make real-time client-side updates based on data from the back-end. This technology was used to display notifications for newly-created events & event updates for Student users and student admin requests for Instructor users
    - Tutorials used: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp 
    - Skeleton without actual calls to back-end: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/c244ec14e77ba1bdf4fe8df9d17229414828514d
- I like to keep my development processes well documented and organized. For our project, I created different tasks and milestones which helped us organize and monitor the progress of our team
- I could keep people more informed of what I am doing as well as getting more information from what other people are doing, so I don’t write unnecessary code

## Amrutha Krishnan (AmruthaKris)
- My most significant contribution was with the front end portion admin requests
    - One of my commits: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/274ad358242f37ce790200f1604972935916a038
- While working on this project I learned how to work with the Django framework, also how to incorporate Bootstrap into the front-end design portion of the assignment. Also, learned how to properly integrate all the different programs like SQL, Python, html and more together. All of this will possibly help me in future projects.
- I believe my main strength would be in creating an appealing design while working on the front end portion of the assignment.
- My main weakness was with multi-tasking and keeping up with the team’s progress towards the end of the assignment after my laptop broke and I had to switch operating systems. 

## Binuri Walpitagamage(binuri)
- My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the backend components of the scheduler application.
    - Link to application source code : https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/tree/master/phase2/csc301_calendar_app/scheduler
- While working on our CourseMate webapp, I learned about how Django implements the observer pattern with signals. I used this technique when creating the backend of the notifications feature of our product.
    - Commit for the notification of student admins: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/f8890c25c5dbdc566799bd144bd78f9c761dadec 
- I tend to learn new concepts fairly quickly. In the beginning, when all the team members were learning the process, this strength came in useful since it gave me the ability to start the initial skeleton of our code base so that everyone else can learn more from it as well as to gradually contribute to it.
    - Initial skeleton commit: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team4-repo/commit/44c09c031faf4e95c267583c412eff599c1574a8
- Upon completion of a task, I usually forget to close the related github issues which results in a false progress status for someone looking at our teams github repo. Therefore I should pay more attention to the administrative details and tasks.
