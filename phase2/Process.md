A report describing your scrum-like process. The report should include the following items:
A summary of your planning and review meetings for both sprints (i.e. 4 meetings in total).
Includes date and location.
Please keep it short, and give us the highlights.
Include important decisions you've made, and arguments for/against them.
Tip: You can use GitHub to label all the user stories you plan to complete during a sprint, and include a link to an issue search result (example) in your planning meeting summary.
For the review/retrospective meeting, we would like to see some numbers and/or interesting statistics.
For example: Percentage of planned work that was actually completed, distribution of completed work among team members, percentage of planned work completed categorized by priority, etc.
The point is to evaluate the estimations that you've made during the planning meeting.

* A summary of your "daily" scrum meetings-- Please include date and location; if you use a chat, you can simply copy-paste the highlight of the chat. A good format would be a list, specifying the highlights of each member's update (each highlights should be 1-3 sentences long).

<b>Planning & Review Meetings</b>

<b>Sprint 1: Meeting 1</b> - October 23 in BA1200

* Description of how you used GitHub issue management system (e.g. naming conventions, labels, team's conventions, etc.)
	- the issue names are prepended with its corresponding model
	- each issue is either tagged back-end or front-end & with the app that it refers to (Scheduler, School & User System) 
	- each issue was assigned based on its corresponding Django app
	- 5 people on back-end team to construct models, tests, views & forms
	- 2 people on front-end team to construct templates & maintain views/ forms
	- in the end, when the basic functionality is done, we need to hook up the front end + back end

* Description of any other major decisions/conventions you may have made/used during the process, and why -- for example: Did you have a "scrum master"? Why? Do you think it was the right decision?

We elected to have a diffrent scrum master at each of our 6 meetings, each team member had the chance to be the scum leader. The scrum leader's role was to chair the meeting, direct conversation flow as well as ensure a timley and effective meeting. Furthermore, each meeting began with a quick update from each group member where they indicated: 
  1) Progress since last meeting 
  2) Any problems they were stuck on
  3) If they felt they were on track to meet their deadline
Additional tasks were then assigned from the spint backlog to members who had finished their respective tasks.
Our group also elected to conduct informal "social media chats" daily to discuss any problems, seek help, and plan meetings.

Reflections on methodologies:

In hindsight we believe using a rotating scrum master was a good descion. This afforded each member the chance to set the agenda for the meeting, re-enforcing the team vision that every opinion counts! Giving each group member a chance to be scrum leader also provided valuable experience to our member and allowed each of us the oppurtunity develop our leadership skills. We recognize the personal growth related to developing these goals will be usefull in our future careers. Reflecting back, the team also agreeded the informal facebook messages were an excellant idea as they allowed us to bounce ideas of each other in an unstructured, casual format.
