A report describing your scrum-like process. The report should include the following items:
A summary of your planning and review meetings for both sprints (i.e. 4 meetings in total).
Includes date and location.
Please keep it short, and give us the highlights.
Include important decisions you've made, and arguments for/against them.
Tip: You can use GitHub to label all the user stories you plan to complete during a sprint, and include a link to an issue search result (example) in your planning meeting summary.
For the review/retrospective meeting, we would like to see some numbers and/or interesting statistics.
For example: Percentage of planned work that was actually completed, distribution of completed work among team members, percentage of planned work completed categorized by priority, etc.
The point is to evaluate the estimations that you've made during the planning meeting.

* A summary of your "daily" scrum meetings-- Please include date and location; if you use a chat, you can simply copy-paste the highlight of the chat. A good format would be a list, specifying the highlights of each member's update (each highlights should be 1-3 sentences long).


<b>Meeting 1</b> - October 23 in BA1200
 - We decided to write our project using Python and Django, as opposed to PHP with Codeigniter, becuase our former teammate Matt had previous experience with Django, and we felt Django was more powerful and interesting to learn than PHP.
 - Notifications and Reminders were deemed bonus features and unnecessary for the first release, and removed from the MVP
 - The team was split into two groups, with Sangah and Amrutha on the front-end, and Carl, Tommy, Binuri, Michael and Matt on the back-end

<b>Meeting 2</b> - October 28 in BA

* Description of how you used GitHub issue management system (e.g. naming conventions, labels, team's conventions, etc.)
	- the issue names are prepended with its corresponding model
	- each issue is either tagged back-end or front-end & with the app that it refers to (Scheduler, School & User System) 
	- each issue was assigned based on its corresponding Django app
	- 5 people on back-end team to construct models, tests, views & forms
	- 2 people on front-end team to construct templates & maintain views/ forms
	- in the end, when the basic functionality is done, we need to hook up the front end + back end

* Description of any other major decisions/conventions you may have made/used during the process, and why -- for example: Did you have a "scrum master"? Why? Do you think it was the right decision?
