## <b>Planning & Review Meetings</b>
### <b>Sprint 1: Meeting 1</b> - October 23 in BA1200
 - The team decided to write our project using Python and Django, as opposed to PHP with Codeigniter, because our former teammate, Matt, had previous experience with Django, and we felt Django was more powerful and interesting to learn than PHP.
 - Notifications and Reminders were deemed bonus features and unnecessary for the first release, and removed from the MVP
 - The team was split into two groups, with Sangah and Amrutha on the front-end, and Carl, Tommy, Binuri, and Michael on the back-end

## Description of GitHub issue management system (e.g. naming conventions, labels, team's conventions, etc.)

  - The issue names are prepended with its corresponding model
  - Each issue is either tagged back-end or front-end & with the app that it refers to (Scheduler, School & User System) 
  - Each issue was assigned based on its corresponding Django app
  - 5 group members were assigned to the back-end team to construct models, tests, views & forms
  - 2 group members were assigned to the front-end team to construct templates & maintain views/ forms
  - Once basic functionality is done, we hooked up the front end and back end

## Description of any other major decisions/conventions

We elected to have a different scrum master at each of our 6 meetings, each team member had the chance to be the scum leader. The scrum leader's role was to chair the meeting, direct conversation flow as well as ensure a timely and effective meeting. Furthermore, each meeting began with a quick update from each group member where they indicated: 
  1. Progress since last meeting 
  2. Any problems they were stuck on
  3. If they felt they were on track to meet their deadline
Additional tasks were then assigned from the sprint backlog to members who had finished their respective tasks.
Our group also elected to conduct informal "social media chats" daily to discuss any problems, seek help, and plan meetings.

### Reflections on methodologies:

In hindsight we believe using a rotating scrum master was a good descion. This afforded each member the chance to set the agenda for the meeting, re-enforcing the team vision that every opinion counts! Giving each group member a chance to be scrum leader also provided valuable experience to our member and allowed each of us the opportunity develop our leadership skills. We recognize the personal growth related to developing these goals will be useful in our future careers. Reflecting back, the team also agreed the informal Facebook messages were an excellent idea as they allowed us to bounce ideas of each other in an unstructured, casual format.
